# Postchain Client Unity

**Compatible with Postchain 3.3.3 / Rell 0.10.5**

This Unity package offers an API for the Chromia Blockchain. It includes normal transaction serialization, an API for Chromia's [FT3 library](https://rell.chromia.com/en/master/advanced-topics/ft3.html) as well as their [SSO](https://rell.chromia.com/en/master/advanced-topics/ft3/ft3-single-sign-on.html).

Currently tested with Standalone (Windows and Linux) as well as WebGL builds.
